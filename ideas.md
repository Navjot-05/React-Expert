### Design Approach: Modern Minimalist with Interactive Depth

**Design Movement:** Contemporary Minimalism with Micro-interactions

**Core Principles:**
- Clean, spacious layouts with strategic use of whitespace
- Subtle depth through layered cards and soft shadows
- Smooth, purposeful animations that enhance rather than distract
- Typography-driven hierarchy with intentional font pairing

**Color Philosophy:**
A sophisticated dark-to-light gradient palette that reflects modern tech aesthetics:
- Primary: Deep slate (#0f172a) for backgrounds, creating a premium feel
- Accent: Vibrant cyan (#06b6d4) for interactive elements and highlights
- Secondary: Soft gray (#e2e8f0) for text and subtle elements
- Tertiary: Warm amber (#f59e0b) for call-to-action buttons
The color scheme conveys professionalism, technical expertise, and approachability.

**Layout Paradigm:**
Asymmetric grid-based layout with:
- Left-aligned hero section with animated code snippets
- Staggered project cards with hover lift effects
- Floating navigation that adapts to scroll position
- Diagonal section dividers for visual interest

**Signature Elements:**
1. Animated code blocks showing actual tech stack (React, Tailwind, JavaScript)
2. Floating particles/nodes connecting skills in an interactive constellation
3. Gradient text effects on key headings

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Hover states reveal additional information
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations
- Interactive skill tags that respond to mouse movement
- Parallax effects on hero section

**Animation Guidelines:**
- Entrance animations: Fade-in with slight upward movement (300ms)
- Hover effects: Subtle scale and shadow elevation
- Scroll animations: Staggered reveals of project cards
- Micro-interactions: Button ripple effects, smooth transitions

**Typography System:**
- Display Font: "Space Grotesk" for headings (bold, geometric, tech-forward)
- Body Font: "Inter" for body text (clean, highly readable)
- Code Font: "Fira Code" for code snippets
- Hierarchy: 48px headings, 24px subheadings, 16px body text

### Design Approach: Bold Gradient Maximalism

**Design Movement:** Contemporary Digital Maximalism with Glassmorphism

**Core Principles:**
- Vibrant, saturated color gradients as primary design elements
- Layered glass-effect cards with backdrop blur
- Dynamic, energetic animations that celebrate motion
- Bold typography with dramatic scale contrasts

**Color Philosophy:**
A vibrant, multi-color gradient system:
- Primary Gradient: Purple (#7c3aed) to pink (#ec4899)
- Secondary Gradient: Blue (#3b82f6) to cyan (#06b6d4)
- Accent: Neon green (#10b981) for highlights
- Background: Dark navy (#0a0e27) with subtle gradient overlay
Creates an energetic, modern, and youthful aesthetic that stands out.

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Full-width hero with animated gradient background
- Overlapping cards with glassmorphism effect
- Diagonal and curved section transitions
- Centered content with strategic asymmetric accents

**Signature Elements:**
1. Animated gradient text that shifts colors on scroll
2. Glassmorphic skill cards with animated borders
3. Floating 3D geometric shapes in background

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Interactive gradient animations on hover
- Cards that follow cursor movement
- Animated skill counters
- Smooth page transitions with gradient wipes

**Animation Guidelines:**
- Entrance: Gradient slide-in animations (400ms)
- Hover: Color shift and scale with glow effect
- Scroll: Parallax with gradient color transitions
- Continuous: Subtle background animation loop

**Typography System:**
- Display Font: "Poppins" for headings (bold, rounded, modern)
- Body Font: "Outfit" for body text (geometric, contemporary)
- Accent Font: "Space Mono" for highlights
- Hierarchy: 56px headings, 28px subheadings, 16px body text

### Design Approach: Elegant Brutalism with Functional Art

**Design Movement:** Digital Brutalism meets Functional Design

**Core Principles:**
- Raw, honest design with exposed structure and typography
- Monochromatic base with strategic color accents
- Emphasis on content hierarchy and readability
- Geometric shapes and bold lines as design elements

**Color Philosophy:**
A sophisticated monochromatic system with purposeful accents:
- Primary: Charcoal (#1a1a1a) for backgrounds
- Secondary: Off-white (#f5f5f5) for content
- Accent 1: Deep orange (#d97706) for primary actions
- Accent 2: Teal (#0d9488) for secondary highlights
The palette conveys confidence, clarity, and technical precision.

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetric grid with prominent typography
- Raw, unrounded card designs with bold borders
- Left-aligned content with right-aligned imagery
- Geometric dividers and section breaks

**Signature Elements:**
1. Large, bold typography as primary visual element
2. Geometric shapes (circles, lines) as decorative elements
3. Raw, unpolished aesthetic with intentional imperfection

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Direct, purposeful interactions without unnecessary flourish
- Bold hover states with color shifts
- Smooth but restrained animations
- Focus on content over decoration

**Animation Guidelines:**
- Entrance: Direct fade-in with no easing (200ms)
- Hover: Color inversion and border emphasis
- Scroll: Minimal animations, focus on content reveal
- Transitions: Sharp, purposeful movement

**Typography System:**
- Display Font: "IBM Plex Sans" for headings (bold, industrial)
- Body Font: "IBM Plex Sans" for body text (consistent, professional)
- Monospace Font: "IBM Plex Mono" for code
- Hierarchy: 52px headings, 26px subheadings, 15px body text
